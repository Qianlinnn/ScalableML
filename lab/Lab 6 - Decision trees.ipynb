    "Notice that the numbers of data observations per class are different. We usually refer to this kind of problems as \"imbalanced\". Bear in mind that when creating your training data, you need to account for this imbalance and be aware against misleading results. For example, accuracy is probably not a good metric to measure performance in these problems. Say you have a binary classification problem for which your test data consists of 100 instances. From those, 99 instances belong to class 1, say 'ham', and 1 instance belong to class 2, say 'spam'. When you test your classifier on these instances, you could have a classifier that only is able to predict class 1 correctly, but elements of class 2 are predicted incorrectly. If you apply this classifier to your test data, you would get 99% accuracy. Looking at this percentage out of context and saying that you have produced a highly realiable classifier is completely wrong since your classifier only learned to correctly classify instances in class 1. The problem gets worse if your test set is large, say 100,000 instances, 99,000 are correctly predicted for class 1 and 1,000 are incorrectly predicted for class 2. Even when the classifier fails in correctly predicted 1,000 instances from class 2, the accuracy of this classifier would be 99%.\n",

Two stategies to use are: i) instead of simply splitting the data blindly, split the data accounting for the imbalance. sckiti-learn offers the class [StratifiedShuffleSplit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html) for this. Using stratified sampling is also important for regression problems. ii) do not trust \"accuracy\" as the sole metric to measure performance. Other classification metrics more suitable for imbalanced problems include [recall, precision, F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall), and [area under the curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). \n",

    "## DecisionTreeClassifier in PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several challenges when implementing decision trees in a distributed setting, particularly when we want to use [commodity hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_computing). A very popular implementation is known as [PLANET: Massively Parallel Learning of Tree Ensembles with MapReduce](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36296.pdf). PLANET allows an efficient implementation of decision trees at large scale purely using map() and reduce() operations, suitable for a Hadoop cluster. Although the Decision Tree implementation in [Apache Spark borrows some of the ideas from PLANET](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-237/15-237.pdf), it also introduces additional tricks that exploit the well-known advantages of Apache Spark, e.g. in memory computing. The Apache Spark implementation of the DecisionTree classifier may not be as flexible as the scikit-learn one (bear in mind they were designed under a different sets of restrictions), but it still allows the use of such a powerful machine learning model at large scale.\n",

The trick is to convert the spark tree to a JSON format. Once you have the JSON format, you can visualise it using [D3](https://d3js.org/) or you can transform from JSON to DOT and use graphviz as we did in scickit-learn.

The pipeline model can be used to find the best set of parameters using cross validation. An example of a cross-validator can be found [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/ml-tuning.html#cross-validation).
